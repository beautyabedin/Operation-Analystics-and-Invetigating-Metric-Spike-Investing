# Operation-Analystics-and-Invetigating-Metric-Spike Investing

## Project Description :

● Operation Analytics:

Operational Analytics is a category of business analytics that's focused on syncing data from your warehouse directly to your business tools – thus ensuring that everyone across your organization has access to the same data regardless of their technical skills. Operations analytics is a subfield of data analytics that focuses on using data to optimize and improve operational processes within an organization .

● Metric Spike:

A metric spike refers to a sudden and significant increase in a particular metric or measurement that is being tracked or analyzed. This can occur in a wide range of data sets and can be observed over a relatively short period of time. This Project focuses on analyzing the data which is provided by the company. With the help of this, the company then finds the areas on which it must improve upon. My task is to derive insights and answer the questionasked by different department like -

#### *In case study-1: the insights are found based on following questions:*

A.Number of jobs reviewed: Amount of jobs reviewed over time.

B.Throughput: It is the no. of events happening per second.

C.Percentage share of each language: Share of each language for different contents.

D.Duplicate rows: Rows that have the same value present in them.

#### *In case study-2: the insights are found based on following questions:*

User Engagement: To measure the activeness of a user. Measuring if the user finds quality in a product/service.

User Growth: Amount of users growing over time for a product.

Weekly Retention: Users getting retained weekly after signing-up for a product.

Weekly Engagement: To measure the activeness of a user. Measuring if the user finds quality in a product/service weekly.

Email Engagement: Users engaging with the email service.

## Approach:

● Download all Data provided

● Create database with the dataset provided for Case Study 1 (Job Data)

● Upload datasets of Case Study 2 (Investigating metric spike) to MySQL Workbench

● Gather insights of database

● Write queries to find answers

● Analyze the information and make proper decision

## Tech-Stack Used:

MYSQL Workbench version 8.0.30. The main purpose of using MySQL workbench is that it provides the console to simply edit and administer the MYSQL environments and to gain better results and insights of the data. It provides data modeling, SQL development and connecting servers and is the best tool to design, generate and manage the databases.

## Insights:

The Knowledge I gained from this Project is how to Create a database with the reference of Excel sheet provided and import large / Uploaded datasets (Investigating metric spike) to MySQL Workbench as all the questions asked could be answered through SQL .

## How this project helped me : 

This project helps me to understand the importance of operation analytics. Through this project I am able to understand how the companies use metric spike as a secret weapon.
